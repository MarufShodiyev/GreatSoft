                    </div>
                    <p>This article is not an attempt to describe project management theory from books. It rather
                        enlists my key project management techniques and principles based on years of practice,
                        pitfalls and pearls.</p>

                    <h4>1. The more risks identified at the planning stage the better</h4>

                    <p>Apart from affecting budget resources and reputation, risks can even lead to project death. A
                        carefully-selected project management technique will help you detect all the major risks at the
                        early stages when you only start building a project model.</p>

                    <p>Imagine you are responsible for developing a high-load system that supports 5,000 users, but you
                        don't have the right team member who can handle such complex projects. For sure, it is a risk as
                        you might fail to find the right fit in time or a newcomer will fail you in the long run.</p>
                    <p>Or, let's say, you need to enable data synchronization between your data storage and a few other
                        3-rd party platforms. So what exactly needs to be done within this project scope? First of all,
                        writing code that will do the necessary synchronization. But what about data integrity, big data
                        support, automatic scaling, automatic process retrieval after the downtime, and finally finding
                        the right tools and ways of testing all the above-mentioned project activities? Does this mean
                        extra time estimates and the risks to be taken into account? For sure, yes. Will all the project
                        managers consider it at the project initiation stage? From my experience, no. Yet, risk
                        management is definitely one of those winning project management techniques that will help you
                        create more accurate estimates as well as prevent unplanned scenarios and frustration. It's
                        better to spend more time on program evaluation and review than later discover significant
                        deviations from the agreed budget and timelines.</p>

                    <p>All the risk types can be checked here in this reliable article, so I will not copy them. But
                        please take them into account when estimating the scope of your next project and creating a
                        project plan.</p>

                    <h4>2. Predict and prevent problems during development</h4>
                    <p>When the development process is on and running, a few problems might evolve: a lack of
                        understanding of how to implement an appropriate technical solution, repository mess, server
                        configuration instability, no data backups, certain team-specific issues, such as low
                        performance of one or multiple developers. That's especially true for more complex projects.</p>

                    <p>In such cases, the owner might fail to (or be unwilling to) discover these issues on the project.
                        Or may know about them, but do nothing. Yet, it's for sure one of the best project management
                        techniques to react to them in a timely manner. This will save dozens of hours and tons of
                        effort in the long run.</p>

                    <p>Any working environment will only get healthier if you keep things organized. Everything that
                        could possibly go wrong, will go wrong. So what's the point in ignoring the problems if they
                        show up later anyway?</p>
                    <p>Lastly, even if you understand the customer requirements well despite hazy specifications, you
                        cannot expect your project team to be on the same page as you are. To achieve the project goal,
                        all the specifications must be well-detailed at the program evaluation and review stage during
                        the team meetings so that any misunderstandings are resolved before they occur.</p>

                    <h4>3. Visualize progress to see the whole picture, use appropriate project management tools</h4>
                    <p>On multiple projects, progress visual representation is an important project management technique
                        that allows you to immediately see project progress, spot any dependent tasks and plan other
                        important tasks. In a project management methodology, the most popular ways of visual
                        representation are Kanban Board and Gantt chart. Some key details are provided below:</p>

                    <h5>Kanban board</h5>
                    <p>Kanban itself is a project management methodology with its own rules. It is well described in
                        this article. I will talk about its visual aspect only, from the perspective of understanding
                        the project workflow. In Kanban Boards, you have different statuses (columns) and a set of tasks
                        in each column, which are moved from left to right systematically, upon changing statuses.</p>

                    <h5>The key things you can see in Kanban Boards:</h5>
                    <p>

                    <img src="GreatSoft__image/blog-section image.png" alt="blog-section image bor">
                    <p>The huge benefit of Kanban Boards is that a project manager does not need to spend time on
                        maintaining them throughout the entire project life cycle, unlike the Gantt Chart that I am
                        describing below.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Gantt chart</h5>
                    <p>In project management, you always need a reliable way of calculating the valid completion dates
                        of specific manageable tasks within one project. A Gantt chart is an ideal solution. It is one
                        of the oldest project management techniques that was originally used in the Waterfall technique,
                        but now it can be easily used in Agile, let's say for visualizing sprints and project progress
                        tracking.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For you as a project manager, the smartest advantage of Gantt charts is seeing the exact project
                        timeline for any task. It might be really useful in identifying task dependencies and seeing how
                        the project progresses. However, it requires spending additional resources on chart maintenance,
                        as you have to constantly reestimate each task separately

                    <h4>
                        4. Always be aware of priorities, approaches and current problems
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Throughout the project life cycle, reconsider task priorities occasionally, discuss approaches
                        with the team (regarding delivery strategy, server infrastructure, technologies, task
                        dependencies, etc), assist the team in resolving current project problems, or make necessary
                        allocations for any new project activities. This project management technique will help you
                        avoid a bunch of common pitfalls that usually occur on a project.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        5. Split the responsibilities correctly to avoid demotivation among the team
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        If project managers assign more complex projects to a developer than his skills level allows him
                        to accomplish at the moment, it is normal as it will contribute to his growth. But if all the
                        tasks related to e.g. administration, automation or infrastructure are assigned to a web
                        developer, then you should expect his demotivation about the job he is doing.А
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In project management, to ensure a balanced work breakdown structure, the above-listed types of
                        tasks should be assigned to other team members, such as an IT administrator, DevOps expert and
                        an infrastructure expert. In addition, it is always better to assign new employees (who you
                        trust) to those smaller tasks than exploit your current team member. If there are no trusted
                        people available, then the problem lies more in recruiting than project management. My
                        recommendation is to start cultivating friendly relationships with experts in different fields.
                        It is highly useful to always be able to have specific/untypical tasks done within a project
                        schedule just because you have the right people at hand and can assign those smaller tasks to
                        them. Even in extreme project management, it is always recommended to have someone qualified for
                        non-typical tasks.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        6. React immediately in critical situations
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Project managers should never hope for luck. If the problem occurred, it cannot be ignored or
                        postponed for later. Technical problems can be resolved by lead developers or tech leads.
                        However, everything related to organization problems, resources planning, task dependencies,
                        decision making, etc., should be a subject of prompt intervention by the management staff who
                        should be able to apply suitable project management techniques depending on the situation.

                        7. Work with the budget carefully
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        When working on any project tasks, whether big or small, respect your client's budget and inform
                        in advance if you feel that one task requires more resources than you estimated initially or if
                        there are certain unplanned task dependencies. It is always a winning project management
                        technique to agree on all the time estimates upfront with your client than "surprise" them
                        later. Dividing the project into distinct phases and work packages is the most reliable
                        evaluation and review technique that will help you plan resources more carefully.

                        8. Be a superhero project manager - grow your soft skills
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        To manage the project successfully and achieve smooth project completion, the importance of soft
                        skills cannot be underestimated. I mean communication, empathy, stress-resistance, leadership,
                        and others.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let's say you have difficulty getting some precise details from the client. This is because he
                        is
                        either a non-technician at all, or just explaining some real case scenarios in a specific domain
                        like fintech. However, you don't understand them, no matter how much research you put into that.
                        Or your whole team overworks to demonstrate the best delivery they can, but the client complains
                        that your work is slow anyway.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Skilled project managers should be able to resolve these and many other unique challenges in an
                        elegant way, so that both parties are left happy with the result. By implementing tried and
                        tested project management techniques that are proven to work, you will contribute to not just
                        your current project's success, but will also get more confidence when working on each next
                        project.

                    <p>
                        Being a good project manager is not just about following specific project management principles
                        and rules. Very often, certain situations require immediate actions when you need to find a
                        solution to some problems on the project. No matter which party caused this problem, the
                        customer or the development team, it needs to be addressed. All the project managers at
                        EcDevStudio are trained to serve as problem-solvers for the customer, not just an intermediary.
                        Out of many project management techniques described above and even more, we never try to find a
                        one-size-fits-all scenario. Each project is unique, so the project management principles and
                        other approaches need to be selected accordingly.

                        In our team, even the choice of the most suitable project manager is made based on some project
                        specifics: technologies to be used, UX focus, etc. Let's say, if the project needs to start with
                        the design stage and the customer deeply relies on excellent UX, we will definitely assign it to
                        a project manager who is a former UX designer. If you are looking for a team you would find
                        comfortable to work with, contact us for free a consultation.
